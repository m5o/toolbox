# toolbox

Files I copy from project to project, sometimes.

## Usage

* Check the markdown file with documentation
* Use the [rench gem](https://github.com/mrmicahcooper/rench) command or use ```curl``` to get it

```bash
$ gem install rench

$ rench m5o <filename> [new_file_location]
```

## Credits

I saw this idea from Micah Cooper in [Put your programming tools in a Toolbox](http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/put-your-programming-tools-in-a-toolbox) post. Thanks [RStankov](https://github.com/RStankov/toolbox) for this hint.
